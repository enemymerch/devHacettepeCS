CODE FILES: part1.m  part2.m


Before running the scripts;
1-the directories for input images should be changed. (dirs at the Beginnig of the script) for both part1.m and part2.m
2-the output director is also should be changed(dir is at the end of the script) for both part1.m and part2.m


PS:While i was coding i had to clear the workspace before i ran the code.
